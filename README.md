<p align="center">
  <strong>A protocol that lets AI agents call any tool, over any channel‚Äîdirectly and without wrappers</strong>
</p>


The **Universal Tool Calling Protocol (UTCP)** is an open standard that describes *how* to call existing tools rather than *proxying* those calls through a new server. After discovery, the agent speaks directly to the tool‚Äôs native endpoint (HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, CLI, ‚Ä¶), eliminating the ‚Äúwrapper tax,‚Äù reducing latency, and letting you keep your existing auth, billing and security in place.
